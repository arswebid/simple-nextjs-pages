# simple-nextjs-pages
In Next.js, you can create multiple pages by creating a new file in the pages folder. Each file in the pages folder becomes a new page in your app.

Here's an example of how to create two pages, index.js and about.js, in a Next.js app:
Create a new file called index.js in the pages folder.
Create a new file called about.js in the pages folder. 
Start your Next.js app by running npm run dev. You should now be able to access the home page at http://localhost:3000 and the about page at http://localhost:3000/about.
By default, Next.js uses file-based routing to map URLs to pages. For example, a file called about.js in the pages folder will create a page at the URL /about. If you need more control over your routing, you can use Next.js's dynamic routing features to create pages with custom URLs.
